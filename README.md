# Spring Boot Project: Category and Transaction Management

This project was created using Spring Boot framework to provide a simple yet powerful solution for managing categories and transactions. It includes an authentication process to ensure secure access to the resources.

## Features:

- **Authentication**: The project includes an authentication process to authenticate users and ensure secure access to the resources.
  
- **Category Management**: The application provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing categories. Users can create, view, update, and delete categories as needed.

- **Transaction Management**: Similarly, the application provides CRUD operations for managing transactions. Users can perform various actions such as adding, viewing, updating, and deleting transactions.

## Technologies Used:

- **Spring Boot**: The project is built using the Spring Boot framework, which simplifies the setup and development of Spring-based applications.

- **Spring Security**: Authentication is implemented using Spring Security to secure the endpoints and manage user authentication.

- **Database**: The project uses a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store category and transaction data. You can configure the database settings in the application properties file.

- **RESTful API**: The application exposes RESTful APIs for interacting with categories and transactions, allowing seamless integration with frontend or other services.

## Getting Started:

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Configure the database settings in the `application.properties` file.
3. Build the project using Maven or Gradle.
4. Run the application using your preferred IDE or the command line.
5. Access the endpoints to manage categories and transactions using tools like Postman or curl.
